## Welcome to the NASA Colorado Space Grant Consortium at CU Boulder - Student Thermal Energetic Activity Module (STEAM)
The Student Thermal Energetic Activity Module (STEAM) is a collaboration with the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) to search for X-ray signatures of coronal heating mechanisms. STEAM is a supplementary experiment to [SwRI’s Polarimeter to UNify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) mission](https://punch.space.swri.edu/).
STEAM's CAD can be seen below, with dimensions.
